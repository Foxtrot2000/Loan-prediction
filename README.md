# Loan-prediction
Banks today are facing a lot of problems and giving out free money to wrong people and people who genuinely require money are not given any help because of Improper Faud detection. Machine Learning can help solve that problem for us.
A classification Program solved with the help of Logistic Regression Algorithm and used KNN for some Increased efficiency
In this Data set, details of 535 people were available to us and we had to predict whether the loan would get approved or not using the given data.
Used the average values to fill up the missing data in the dataset. 
Used the dummy variables function of Pandas for some attributes given in the form of String to convert them to integers and get their corresponding values.
